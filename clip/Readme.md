# Basic JavaScript #1


## Run JavaScript without browser
Open command prompt.

Navigate to folder with scripts. Ex.: `C:\Programming\cd-js-2017\BasicJs\00_HelloWorld.js`.

Execute command `node 00_HelloWorld.js`.

Expected output is `Hello world!`.

Node is the program that substitutes browser. It runs JavaScript programs.

Open 00_HelloWorld.js in text editor and examine it's content.


## Comment your JavaScript Code

Create a `//` style comment that contains at least five letters.

Create a `/* */` style comment that contains at least five letters.

Make sure that you close the comment with a `*/`.


## Declare JavaScript Variables

Important data types for start: `boolean`, `string`, `number`, and `object`.

Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and `$` or `_`, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.


## Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

Assign the value `7` to variable `a`.

Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.

Do not change code above the line
`a` should have `a` value of `7`
`b` should have `a` value of `7`
`a` should be assigned to b with `=`
